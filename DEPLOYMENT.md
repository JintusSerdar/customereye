## Quick Reference

### URLs
- **Production**: https://demo.customereye.ai (main branch)  
- **Staging**: https://customereye-git-develop-jintusserdars-projects.vercel.app (develop branch)  
- **Feature Previews**: https://customereye-git-[feature-name]-jintusserdars-projects.vercel.app

## Branch Strategy
| Branch      | Purpose                       | Deployment |
|-------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| `main`      | Production (live site)        | https://demo.customereye.ai |
| `develop`   | Staging / integration         | https://customereye-git-develop-jintusserdars-projects.vercel.app |
| `feature/*` | Isolated feature branches     | `https://customereye-git-[feature]-jintusserdars-projects.vercel.app` |

---

## Daily Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Start a New Feature
```bash
git switch develop
git pull --rebase origin develop
git switch -c feature/your-feature
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make Changes & Test
```bash
# Edit code
git add -p        # or: git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of changes"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature

# Preview URL:
# https://customereye-git-[feature]-jintusserdars-projects.vercel.app
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Merge to Staging
```bash
# Open PR: base = develop, compare = feature/your-feature
# After review, merge ‚Üí develop.
# Staging auto-updates:
# https://customereye-git-develop-jintusserdars-projects.vercel.app
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Release to Production
```bash
git switch main
git pull --rebase origin main
git merge --no-ff develop -m "Release: <summary>"
git push origin main

# Production: https://demo.customereye.ai
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Clean Up After Merging a Feature
```bash
git switch develop
git pull --rebase origin develop
git branch -d feature/your-feature        # delete locally
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature  # delete remotely
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Safe Rebase (Keep a Feature Branch Updated)
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop      # replay commits on top of latest develop
git push --force-with-lease    # only if you had pushed before
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use `--force-with-lease` (never `--force`)** to avoid overwriting teammates' work.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ When NOT to Rebase
- When teammates are already working off your branch
- When a PR is open and under review
- On protected branches (main, develop, releases)
- On commits owned/published by others

**Safer options:**
```bash
# Merge base into your feature instead:
git switch feature/your-feature
git fetch origin
git merge origin/develop
git push
```

---

## Emergency Rollback
```bash
git switch main
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
```

---

## Useful Git Flags (Cheat Sheet)
| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-c` | create branch with `git switch -c` |
| `--rebase` | replay commits on top of updated branch |
| `-d` | delete local branch if merged |
| `-D` | force delete local branch |
| `-u` | set upstream for easy push/pull |
| `--no-ff` | force merge commit (preserve bubble) |
| `--force-with-lease` | safe force push |

---

## Vercel CLI Tips
```bash
# See all deployments
vercel ls

# Check deployment status
vercel inspect [deployment-url]

# View logs
vercel logs [deployment-url]

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Deploy preview
vercel
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Deployment fails:**
```bash
# Check build logs
vercel logs [deployment-url]

# Check environment variables
vercel env ls
```

**Domain not working:**
1. Check DNS records are correct
2. Wait for DNS propagation (5-10 minutes)
3. Verify domain is added in Vercel dashboard

**Build errors:**
```bash
# Test locally first
npm run build
npm run start

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run lint
```
